Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, Jupyter notebook, Machine Learning Algorithm

**Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing vaccination-related data to predict vaccination outcomes. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to uncover key insights and create a predictive model for vaccination predictions.

**Features:**

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Manage missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistics to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
- **Building Predictive Models:** Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict vaccination outcomes.

**Project Workflow:**

- **Data Collection:** Load the dataset into a structured format (e.g., CSV or database).
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handle missing values.
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Normalize or scale numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualize feature distributions.
  - Explore correlations and feature importance.
- **Model Training:**
  - Implement classification models such as logistic regression, random forests, or XGBoost.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Conclusion:**

- The Gradient Boosting Classifier excels in predicting both H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination uptake, achieving high F1 Scores (89.17% for H1N1 and 82.97% for Seasonal) and strong ROC AUC values (86.69% for H1N1 and 85.72% for Seasonal).
- Important factors for deciding to get vaccinated include having a young child, being a health worker, going outside often, having chronic health issues, and getting advice from doctors. Other factors like household setup, health insurance, and beliefs about vaccine safety also play a role, but are less important.

The project offers a detailed analysis of vaccination prediction data, highlighting the key factors influencing vaccination uptake. These insights are valuable for informing public health strategies and enhancing vaccination rates
